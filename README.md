# What is GPT3?

GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. GPT-3 is the successor to GPT-2 and was released by OpenAI in June 2020. It is a large-scale language model that was trained on a dataset of 45TB of text, making it the largest language model ever created. GPT-3 is designed to generate human-like text by predicting the next word in a sentence given the previous words. It can be used to generate natural language text, answer questions, and even generate code.
